## Molecular Similarity in a Chemical Space

ChemSpaceMap creates a 2D and 3D visualization of a chemical dataset with **PCA, t-SNE** and **UMAP**, using a curated Tuberculosis
dataset from ChEMBL. 

By exploring the source code you will see

* How to install the relevant packages 
* Embed your SMILES as (extended-connectivity fingerprints) ECFPs
* Reduce high-dimensional vectors to 2 and 3 dimensions  
* How to represent chemical space in 2D and 3D

## Libraries required

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - python package for easy and intuitive data manipulation and analysis

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) -  the fundamental package for array computing with Python

* [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) - provides graphing, analytics, and statistics tools, as well as scientific graphing libraries for Python, R and other languages.

* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - a faster way to build and share data apps

Libraries were used in a [Anaconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment using python 3.10.4

## Launch the app

```
streamlit run app.py

```
The files must be in the same directory as app.py

Make sure to run this code in the working directory
